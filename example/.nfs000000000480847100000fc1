Small training data (3000 unmapped reads saved in .fastq format) is distributed with the ROP package. Please note that selected reads are randomly selected and might not represent the typical reads of RNA-Seq experiment. 

Reads were selected from an RNA-Seq sample of normal skin (SRR1146076). 

RNA-Seq sample was downlaoded from here:
