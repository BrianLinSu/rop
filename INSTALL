No installation is required. The ROP comes with no pre-requirements except Python. Python is required to be installed on the cluster you are planning to perform the analysis. ROP is distributed with several open source components that were developed by other groups (see section Third Party software from software web page).

ROP requires the prepared reference databases for human and microbial sequences, which can be download as shown bellow. 

cd rop
python install.py --standard

The 'installation' might take up to 45 minutes on average and requires 50Gb of available space to download the references.
